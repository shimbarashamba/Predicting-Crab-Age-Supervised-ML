# Predicting-Crab-Age-Supervised-ML
Supervised machine learning has been used to predict crab age based on physical attributes. The dataset used can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sidhus/crab-age-prediction
Many regression models were tested, RandomForestRegression was chosen in the end. The hyperparameters were then tuned and the model was tested against a dummy regressor with strategy mean, as well as a regular linear regression model with standard settings.
